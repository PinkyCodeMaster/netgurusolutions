## Setup your development

Learn how to get started with Athena locally and deploy it to your platform.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone Athena repository locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository for Athena on your GitHub account. You can find this repository on your
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing your changes ensures they look as intended. Athena comes with a command line interface (CLI) to help render your updates locally. 
    1. Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally with this command: 
    ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your Athena project (where `mint.json` is located): 
    ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
    The Athena Github app automatically deploys your changes to the platform, so you don’t need to manage deployments manually. You can find the link to install on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once installed, there will be a check mark next to the commit hash of the repo.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
    [Commit and push your changes to Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push) for your updates to take effect on your platform. If the GitHub app does not deploy your changes successfully, you can manually update your Athena instance through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
